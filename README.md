# NYC-Bike-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression

For this assignment, you’ll use the New York Bike Counts dataset to formulate a hypothesis about the number of bikes crossing the Brooklyn Bridge. This dataset contains the number of bikes that crossed each bridge during each day. You’ll first use this dataset to formulate a hypothesis and then use linear regression to test if your hypothesis was correct.

Instructions


Use the provided code to first import the dependencies and then import the data.


Inspect the “Day” and “Brooklyn Bridge” columns by using a scatter plot.


Using the number of bikes crossing the Brooklyn Bridge over time in April as your data, create and document an analytical question, a hypothesis, a null hypothesis, an alternative hypothesis, and a significance level.


Perform a linear regression to evaluate your null and alternative hypotheses.


Check the reported p value of the linear regression, and determine if enough evidence exists to reject the null hypothesis.


Document your conclusion in the provided cell.
